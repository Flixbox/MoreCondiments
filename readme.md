## Condiments

### Hemogen Infused Sauce

A thick sauce for bloodfeeders. However, when cooking it the sauce gains a rich flavour, making it enjoyable even for non-bloodfeeders.

### Corn starch

High-amylose corn starch decreases blood glucose and insulin response and increases satiety, or how long someone feels full after eating.

### Dextrose

A sweet condiment that provides energy and focus.

### Ambrosia sauce

A divine sauce, enhancing flavour by quite a lot. Ambrosia sauce is not addictive when cooked into a meal.

### Berry jam

A sweet paste, vibrant and fruity. Slightly improves movement speed.

### Condensed milk

A sweet milk that distracts from the woes of daily life. Slightly improves manipulation.

### Cheese sauce

An extremely filling sauce. You won't be eating for a while after eating a meal made with this sauce.

### Broth

There are several kinds of broths, each providing more boosts to the entire body.

- **Simple broth**: Just a mood boost.
- **Fine broth**: A few boosts to various stats.
- **Lavish broth**: Stronger boosts to multiple stats.
- **Gourmet broth**: Strong boosts to many stats.
